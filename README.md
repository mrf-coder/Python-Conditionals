# Python-Conditionals

```
Conditional definition in Python refers to control flow statements that allow code execution to
 depend on whether certain conditions are met. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif (else if), and else.
 These statements enable a program to make decisions and execute
 different blocks of code based on the truthiness of specified conditions. 
if statement:
This statement executes a block of code only if the specified condition evaluates to True.
elif statement:
This statement allows checking multiple conditions in sequence. It is used after an if statement
and executes its block of code only if the preceding if or elif conditions are False and its own condition is True.
else statement:
This statement provides a default block of code to execute if none of the preceding if or elif conditions are True.
